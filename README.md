# CodeVulnerabilityML

Code vulnerability creates potential risks of compromising
the software security, allowing hackers to take advantage
of the code by attaching an endpoint to extract data or tampering
the software.

This paper studies whether the security vulnerabilities in
a software source code are learnable through the partnership
of data-driven learning with a combination of supervised and
unsupervised learning process. The reason of this study is that,
while data-driven models are more expressive, rule-based models
are instead more interpretable. Moreover, rule-based models are
not sufficiently representative of data, and data-driven models
are yet unable to discover fully generalizable patterns.


For this purpose, we propose a hybrid approach, which relies
on both data-driven and rule-based methods to learn the existing
vulnerabilities. In this paper the rules are governed by an
ensemble classification method, namely random forest, which
combines the output of multiple decision trees to reach a single
result. Using a recurrent neural network (RNN), we initially
encode source code into distributed continuous vectors, while
preserving semantic-syntactic properties of the code. Polling a
large number of decision trees, we then allow the majority of
votes to select a binary label for code snippets according to their
distance. The evaluation results show that the proposed approach
surpass several rule-based and data-driven algorithms in terms
of classification accuracy.
